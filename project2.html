        A game developed over 96 hours by a team of 10 for the GMTK 2024 Game Jam. Our submission ranked 2136 out of 7,643 entries. At the time, it was the largest Game Jam in Itch.io's history.

    <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Unity (C#)</li>
        <li>Git & GitHub (version control and collaboration)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
        The Game Jam's theme was "Built to Scale". We took that quite literally and made a tower defense game where you build the towers and apply upgrades to scale them. While conceptually straightforward, implementing a scalable tower defense system within a 96-hour time constraint presented significant architectural and coordination challenges.
    </p>

    <h2>My Job</h2>
    <p>
        My role in the project was to design and implement the foundational architecture that the rest of the team built upon. I developed the stage system, including dynamic stage loading, enemy spawning, and tile interaction mechanics, ensuring that other team members had the tools and interfaces necessary to implement their features. I also served as the primary integration lead, making sure individual scripts functioned cohesively within the core architecture. When necessary, I refactored core systems and built additional tooling to support feature development and maintain cross-system compatibility.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, I worked closely with the lead frontend developer to refine the overall game vision and ensure that the underlying systems supported the gameplay and UI requirements needed for implementation.
    </p>

    <h2>Scripts Primarily Written by Me</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>WaveManager.cs</li>
        <li>stageManager.cs</li>
        <li>tileScript.cs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technical Accomplishments</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Architected and implemented the complete stage system within the engine</li>
        <li>Developed core gameplay infrastructure, including stage loading, enemy spawning, and tile interaction systems</li>
        <li>Led cross-team integration efforts to ensure cohesive interaction between independently developed modules</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reflections</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Version control is critical in collaborative development and must be managed carefully to prevent integration issues.</li>
        <li>Larger teams introduce coordination complexity, requiring clear communication and a shared understanding of system requirements.</li>
        <li>Time constraints significantly impact development quality; proactive planning and task delegation help mitigate last-minute bottlenecks.</li>
    </ul>
