        During my Systems Engineering Internship at CAS Severn, a local government client requested a program to automate record-keeping for their Nutanix cluster and generate structured Excel reports for internal use. As the only programmer on the team, I architected and development the software from the ground up.
    </p>

    <!-- Problem Section -->
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
        The client requested a program to automate record-keeping for their Nutanix cluster by generating structured Excel reports. They were operating on a legacy version of Nutanix with an API that lacked publicly available documentation. I did not have direct access to the client’s system, which was uniquely configured, and all communication was conducted through a manager.
    </p>

    <!-- Solution Section -->
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>
        I reverse-engineered the legacy API from modern documentation to build a Windows-based GUI application that securely interfaced with the client's cluster and automated report generation. The application standardized cluster reporting and eliminated manual record compilation.
    </p>

    <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>C#</li>
        <li>.NET Framework</li>
        <li>Windows Forms (event-driven desktop application architecture)</li>
        <li>Nutanix Prism API (v1 - Rest integration)</li>
        <li>Newtonsoft.Json.Linq (dynamic JSON parsing)</li>
        <li>OpenXML (Excel report generation)</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Technical Highlights -->
    <h2>Technical Highlights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed and developed a Windows-based GUI application, expanding the original CLI requirement to improve usability.</li>
      <li>Implemented robust error handling and logging systems to enable remote troubleshooting without direct access to the client's cluster.</li>
      <li>Translated client requirements into technical specifications while coordinating communication through management.</li>
      <li>Independently architected and delivered production software adopted by a local government client.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Major Learnings -->
    <h2>Major Learnings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed and integrated with APIs, including reverse-engineering undocumented legacy systems.</li>
      <li>Applied defensive programming techniques to improve reliability, validation, and error handling.</li>
      <li>Architected and delivered a complete software solution independently, from requirements analysis to deployment.</li>
      <li>Translated ambiguous requirements into a scalable, maintainable system design.</li>
      <li>Adapted to real-world engineering constraints, including limited documentation, restricted system access, and indirect client communication.</li>
    </ul>
